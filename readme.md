SHOOT 'EM ALIENS

A simple C++ graphics.h game that I created for my secondary school project.

Controls:
Arrow keys to rotate turret / choice in menu. 
X to fire laser. 
Enter to accept choice.

Objective:
Aliens (the green blobs moving on screen) are your targets.
(More in the instructions segment of the game)

Dependencies:
Borland C++ Compiler (Turbo C) will be needed.
Easily obtained for MacOSX or Windows.
Once you have them, run this file in the compiler after including the Graphics library (Options -> Linker -> Libraries).
Also make sure that the initgraph function in the CPP file points to the right BGI directory. 
Shouldn't be a problem with MacOSX as I just made it what it should be for a default installation in a MacOSX set-up.
